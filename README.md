This Telegram bot is written in Python and built using the Aiogram framework for handling bot interactions. The use of async functions allows the bot to handle 1000s users simultaneously, depending on server resources, task complexity, and database performance. SQLAlchemy is used to manage the database, where data such as brand, model, and price are stored. The dynamic nature of the database allows new entries to be added, keeping the catalog continuously updated.
